# CSMA-CD

The project simulates the working of Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
detection (CSMA/CD) in which six Stations/nodes are in tandem with each other
(multiple Access to the same network. Each station has to send 4 frames through
the channel. After the end of each iteration, the status of all the stations
along with the status of the frames sent is printed on the screen. Special
threading functions are used so as to simulate that the frames are being sent
through the channel at the same time.
